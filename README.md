# Content reactions â€“ a Matomo plugin in the making
Matomo + Jamstack fusion to allow website visitors to feedback and react to the content, without effort.

## What is the point of *Content reactions*?
Well, simply put we'd like to gather qualitative signals alongside the quantitative data already present in Matomo. At Whitespace we believe the best insights in web analytics is to be found combining different methods. Such as mixing quantative metrics with qualitative data. Then it's easier to approach even more business questions through Matomo. With user segments differentiating users by their reactions, for instance.

We are aware that *Content reactions* is not replacing surveys, the work of an experienced User Experience professional's or an accessibility expert's review. But we strive to make it easier to relate to the users' experiences and combine it with the features already to be found in Matomo Analytics.

## What about the license?
We have not yet decided the licence or version of any specific license. But make no mistake, it will be open, transparent and permissive.
